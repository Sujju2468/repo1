To  generate an SSH-2 RSA key pair and save it in PuTTY's own format (you will be prompted
       for the passphrase):

       puttygen -t rsa -C "my home key" -o mykey.ppk

       To generate a larger (4096-bit) key:

       puttygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my home key" -o mykey.ppk

       To change the passphrase on a key (you will be prompted for the old and new passphrases):

       puttygen -P mykey.ppk

       To change the comment on a key:

       puttygen -C "new comment" mykey.ppk

       To convert a key into OpenSSH's private key format:

       puttygen mykey.ppk -O private-openssh -o my-openssh-key

       To convert a key from another format (puttygen will automatically  detect  the  input  key
       type):

       puttygen my-ssh.com-key -o mykey.ppk

       To  display  the fingerprint of a key (some key types require a passphrase to extract even
       this much information):

       puttygen -l mykey.ppk

       To add the OpenSSH-format public half of a key to your authorised keys file:

       puttygen -L mykey.ppk >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
